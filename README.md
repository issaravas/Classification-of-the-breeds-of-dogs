# üê∂ Classification of Dog Breeds

## Project Overview
A computer vision project focused on classifying different dog breeds using deep learning.
We will use **transfer learning with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to achieve high accuracy in breed identification.

### **Dataset Structure**  
The dataset is based on the **[Stanford Dogs Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/stanford-dogs-dataset)**, containing images of various dog breeds.  
The data has been **cleaned, resized, and augmented** to improve model performance.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Project Workflow**
**1. Data Preprocessing**
- Analyzed the dataset: the number of images per class, the distribution of image sizes.
- Resized all images to **224x224** while preserving aspect ratio (padding).
- Augmented images to prevent overfitting.
- Visualized sample images from the dataset before augmentation and resizing, as well as after the applied transformations.

**2. Data Loading**
- Converted images into **PyTorch tensors**.
- Created **train, validation, and test DataLoaders** for efficient batch processing.
